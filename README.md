DRAW for Timex/Sinclair 1000 (aka Sinclair ZX81). My first "real" program written in ~1983 when I was in elementary school. 

Use the U, N, J, H keys to move the cursor Up, Down, Right, or Left. 

Press 1 for pen up, 2 for pen down. C to clear the screen. S to stop. 

Want to save your picture? Break out the Polaroid.
